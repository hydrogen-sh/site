## Calture Festival
This is a publicity and image posting site that I created for a school festival.
It was not actually used at the festival, but I learned a lot about exchanging data with the server.

## Platformer Game
While I usually make games in Unity, I tried to see how well I could make games in HTML.
I never thought I could make a good game, and in fact, I couldn't.
Instead, with the support of my friends, I succeeded in making the worst game I had ever made.
Instead, with the support of my friends, I succeeded in making the worst game in my history.
